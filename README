# Racket-DATABASE

  A simple implementation in Racket of a "mini" database. The defined database
db was used for testing the functionality. The following operations were
implemented:

  -> init-database = initiates a blank database;
  -> create-table = receives as arguments the name of the table and the names of 
                    the columns that define it and returns a table without entries
                    with this information;
  -> get-name = receives a table as argument and returns its name;
  -> get-columns = receives a table as argument and returns its column names;
  -> get-tables = receives as a parameter a database and returns a list of tables in
                  that database;
  -> get-table = receives a database and a table name as arguments, and returns the
                 database table to the specified name;
  -> add-table = receives arguments as a database and a table it inserts into that
                 database, returning the result (a database);
  -> remove-table = receives a database and the name of the table it will delete
                    from the database, returning the result (a database).
  -> insert = inserts and entry in the database
  (insert db table-name record) where :
     * db = database
     * table-name = the name of the table where we are going to insert the information;
     * record = a list of pairs that will contain the information corresponding to the
                line to be inserted into the table. The first element of the pair is the
                column name, and the second value of the column.
  -> simple-select = this operation is used to retrieve information from all the records
                     of a table for certain columns.
  (simple-select db table-name columns) where:
     * db = database;
     * table-name = the name of the table where we are going to extract the information;
     * columns = a list containing the names of the columns for which the information
                 in the table is to be extracted;
  
  The result of this operation is a list containing the values extracted for each column
indicated. For each column the results are retained in a list. In conclusion, the result
is a list containing n lists, where n represents the number of columns in the columns list.
  
  -> select = This operation has the same effect as simple-select, but allows adding
            conditions, and will only extract records from the table that meet all the
            specified conditions. The selected operation will have the following syntax:
  (select db table-name columns conditions) where:
      * columns = is a list that may contain a column name or a pair of an operation
                  and a column name;
      * conditions = is a list that will contain the conditions that the selected records
                     have to meet.
  Possible operations that may appear in the columns list are as follows:
      min - will keep the minimum element as the value in the column;
      max - will keep the maximum element as the value in that column;
      count - will determine the number of values in the column;
      sum - will determine the sum of the elements in that column;
      avg - will determine the arithmetic mean of the items in that column;
      sort-asc - sort the items in that column incrementally;
      sort-desc will sort down the items in that column.
  
  -> update = Changing one or more records in a table is done using the update statement whose
             general shape is the following:
  (update db table-name values conditions)where:
     db = database where the table to be changed is found;
     table-name = the table name where the records will be changed;
     values = a list of pairs (Column / value name), containing the values to be written in the
              columns indicated for the records that meet the conditions;
     conditions = a list of conditions that a record must meet to be editable. The terms have
                the same form and significance as the selected operation.
                
   -> delete = Deleting one or more lines in a table will be done using the delete operation
              whose syntax is the following;
   (delete db table-name conditions) where:
      db = database where there is a table from which to delete records;
      table-name = name of the table to be modified;
      conditions = a list of conditions that should be met by a record in order to be deleted
                   from the table. The terms have the same form and significance as the selected
                   operation.
